[![license](https://img.shields.io/github/license/mashape/apistatus.svg)]()
### Project description:
We found the following challenge on [![challenge.gov](https://www.challenge.gov/challenge/the-2016-fda-naloxone-app-competition/)], the hub for listing challenge and prize competitions, all of which are run by more than 100 agencies across the federal government. These problem-solving events include idea, creative, technical and scientific competitions in which U.S. federal agencies invite the public’s help to solve perplexing mission-centric problems.

#### Our challenge description:
We chose to design an app that helps get Naloxone, an antidote that immediately reverses a drug overdose, to people who are experiencing an opioid overdose. We searched the challenge.gov website for listings of challenge competitions where more than 100 U.S. federal agencies invite the public to help solve perplexing mission-centric problems.




Challenge: We designed an app that helps get Narcan, an antidote that immediately reverses a drug overdose, to people who are experiencing an overdose. We searched the challenge.gov website for listings of challenge competitions where more than 100 U.S. federal agencies invite the public to help solve perplexing mission-centric problems.

What: This is an app that shows a map of fire stations, hospitals and pharmacies that carry Narcan.

Solves the problem by: This app allows the user to sign up, sign in, and quickly see a map of the closest locations that carry Narcan. Our future goals for this app are to have crowd sourcing capabilities so that anyone can add a Narcan location, or register themselves as a carrier of Narcan. We will also add the ability for the user to click a button that notifies the registered carriers via Twilio text asking them if they can deliver their Narcan.



#### Our challenge description:
We want to apply a crowdsourced community solution to helping people get Narcan when they need it. By the time we are finished with this presentation, someone will have died from a drug overdose from such drugs as oxycontin, heroin or fentanyl. That’s the reality today. In 2015 the US had over 33,000 people die from Opioid overdose according to the CDC. Half of these from prescription painkillers. In 2016, more Americans died from overdose than in the Vietnam War. It’s an epidemic and was just declared a public health emergency as early as yesterday. It’s not easy to talk about this, as many of us are affected personally myself included.

However, there is an effective way to bring someone back from the brink. It’s called Narcan and it’s an opioid antagonist. Narcan can be administered through a small nasal inhaler by virtually anyone. It works by binding itself to the body’s opioid receptors in the brain. The compound has more affinity to these receptors than the opioids do. Thus blocking the drug from being absorbed in further and effectively reversing the OD symptoms such as respiratory failure.  Our hope is to provide people who want to help with multiple resources for them to turn to when they recognize that someone is having an overdose.

Our app Narcan Now is a clean, simple interface that utilizes React for rendering live updates and Google Maps API for up to date location data. The idea and focus of our app really focuses on two goals. One is showing the locations of Narcan and providing an interface for a person who wants to help someone who is in the middle of an OD. Though it should be noted that no matter how close a potential source can be one should always call 911 first.

#### Tools we used:
Node.js, Express, MongoDB, and Mongoose, oAuth, Twilio API, Google maps API.
