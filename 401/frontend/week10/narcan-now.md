We found the following challenge on [![challenge.gov](https://www.challenge.gov/challenge/the-2016-fda-naloxone-app-competition/)], the hub for listing challenge and prize competitions, all of which are run by more than 100 agencies across the federal government. These problem-solving events include idea, creative, technical and scientific competitions in which U.S. federal agencies invite the publicâ€™s help to solve perplexing mission-centric problems.
