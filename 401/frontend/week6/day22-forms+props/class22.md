CODE REVIEW:
IN SCSS FILE - to get rid of drop down arrows:

```
select {
  -webkit-appearance: none;
  text-align-last: center;
}

button, select, option {
  width: 100%;
  padding: $gutter-sm;
  margin: ($gutter-sm / 2) 0;


  transition: 350ms;
}
```
FORMS!!!!

- event handlers

IN MIAN.JS
render(){

}

- use a ? operator on a class for the red border (should be applied to the form...)
