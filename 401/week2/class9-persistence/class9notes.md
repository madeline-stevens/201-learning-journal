to do:

- persistence- file system storage
- DRY out repetitive code- where to repeat?
- Testing: mocking data with faker (faker will generate random data, so you don't have to rely on testing one single piece of data)
-

weeks to come:
after monday holiday- revisit express
- AWS component to store images and we'll use postman for this.
