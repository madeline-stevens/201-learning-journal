For today's lab, simply just let us know how your whiteboarding session went.

What did you learn?
  - I take decent class notes that helped us solve some mysteries.
  - .filter will return a boolean value.
  - We were all asking good questions of each other.

What challenges did you have?
  - We were referring to MDN but that still didn't help us much.

What areas of whiteboarding do you feel strong at?
  - Getting the board split up into sections, running through the whiteboarding checklist.
  - Collaborating with the team to get at least a rough draft on the board.

What areas of whiteboarding do you feel weak at?
  - Actually getting a chance to have the marker in my hand, looking back at the "interviewers."
  - Pseudo coding! And not just jumping to what I think a rough draft should look like.
  - Using an eraser and not my hand.
