Big O cheat sheet:

I watched Gayle Laakmann McDowell's video. Then watched this video, which summarized a bit quicker with examples.

O(1)- Static. An example is Gayle's carrier pigeon story where it will always take a pigeon 60 minutes to travel 50 miles no matter how much data is on the usb drive.

O(log N)- "Divide and conquer" technique, a binary search. Breaks up a list into two, for instance, and allows your you and your search to rule out 50% of the list right off the bat.  

O(N)- Directly, and linearly linked with N. An example is the time it takes to read a book depends on how long the book is.

O(N log N)- Merge search. An example is searching through a deck of cards for a specific card.

O(N^2)- Exponential search. An example is checking your list of needed grocery items and your shopping cart.

O(Infinity)- An example is flipping a coin for heads. This could last forever, it probably won't, but it could.
