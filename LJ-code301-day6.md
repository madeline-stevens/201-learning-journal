# 301 Learning Journal: day 6 (July 19, 2017)

Earlier in the week we broke down URLs. In preparation for ajax requests, SQL statements and postgres.

BREAKING DOWN URLs:
- https://blog.mysite.io/articles/1
  - 1. https-- is the protocol, dictates the type of connection or communication (ssl, ftp, sftp, http(server port:80), https(serverport:8080))
  - 2. blog-- is the sub domain
  - 3. mysite-- is the domain ...
  - 4. io-- is the tld (why is it popular: io- input/output)
  - 5. articles-- is the path: ID, or the route.
