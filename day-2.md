# Learning Journal: Day 2

Sigh, where to begin?

I've been spending most of my time on JavaScript and Terminal. I think I've been neglecting CSS. I really enjoyed the About Me class assignment today. We were able to start from scratch and that really helped gauge where I was and how I felt about everything we've covered so far.

I will definitely have more to next time

# Learing Journal: Day 4

I'd really like to be doing more code review. More white boarding. Focus more on the readings. I need to be getting more sleep. I've been staying on campus until I finish all my work, so I'm here until 8:30pm or 9pm which I prefer. I asked my friends in 401 how to best prepare for week 2 of 201 and they just keep saying that we will have an impossible amount of work and we will be doing things we are very unfamiliar with "but the sooner we can just accept that and be okay with that the better." Basically, do our best, while getting enough sleep, and we'll be fine.
