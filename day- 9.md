# Learning Journal: Day 9 (June 16, 2017)

It's Friday of week 2 and I'm excited for this to be a day of debugging. My lab table is almost done and then I plan on working on CSS this weekend. I focused on collaboration, reading out code aloud, helping classmates that missed a day catch up, and javascript this past week. Thank you for all your help, TAs!!!
