# 301 Learning Journal: day 1 (July 11, 2017)

Today, day two, I stayed away from class because my "mild form of strep" manifested into what felt like severe strep last night. I was really bummed to miss the first pair programming assignment because I had prepped myself for it the night before and just really wanted to get it done. My pair programming partner, Zach, who I've worked with many times before in 201 is always so patient and helpful.

He offered to work with me remotely this morning. He slacked me what he was doing and made every effort to include me and ask for input, but he did the majority of the work.

I'm still working on the mobile hamburger button for the mobile-first assignment so that I can incorporate that into my portfolio assignment.

I really wish I wasn't missing a day of class.
