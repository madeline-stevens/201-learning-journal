# 301 Learning Journal: day 8 (July 20, 2017) (LJ-code301-day8.md)

Yesterday Michelle and I got started on the SQL and postgres lab due today, thursday, without Aaron, because his routine is to get here at 7am and leave around 5 or 5:30pm.

I love this assignment. Michelle and I had an awesome discussion and will get the opportunity to have it again with Aaron once he comes in.

This sort of demonstrates how great the new schedule can be. We get two opportunities to go over the lab with partners. And then a third, when we're in class doing code review.
