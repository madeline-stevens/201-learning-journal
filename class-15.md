# Learning Journal: Day 15 (June 24, 2017)

The past few days we finished up Bus Mall by adding an order form and a warehouse page which requires that we use local storage to store the buyers information so that it can then be retrieved by the warehouse page. I wish our group had asked for help sooner. I really wanted to learn how to do that. But we accomplished the first goal I had which was getting all three of us to contribute and push to github. It was still an utter git show.
