Three technical topics that interest me:

1. Screen reader software: I'm interested in how UI can work best for people with accessibility needs. How programs like voiceover for mac, JAWS for windows and other screen reader applications can be improved for people with low vision or who are blind.There are two problems with these programs that I am interested in solving. When there are system wide updates aspects of these screen reader programs sometimes don't work like they're supposed to. There is also very poor documentation on how to utilize these screen readers, there needs to be better tutorials or support. I would like to work for Apple on teams that are passionate about these things too.

2. Bug fixing software updates: I would love to know more about this. And what's involved. I've worked with so many people with low vision who will have an automatic update happen and then it completely resets their voice over settings on their phone, which can leave their phone useless to them.

3. I would love to continue with Apple: I hope to keep working within the Apple community.
