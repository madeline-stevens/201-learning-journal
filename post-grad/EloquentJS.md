Question and an observation 

Ch. 3- Functions--
The Call Stack

Observation:
pg. 46- This was a really quick explanation of the call stack and I think we covered it a bit better in class. But perhaps the main focus of this small section was just to mention how call stacks utilize computer memory, sometimes there can be "too much recursion" which results in infinite loops?

Ch. 4- Data Structures: Objects and Arrays--
pg. 77- Within the summary she uses a great metaphor for arrays explaining that they group several values into a single value.

"Conceptually, this allows us to put a bunch of related things in a bag and run around with the bag, instead of trying to wrap our arms around all the individual things and trying to hold on to them separately."

Observation:
I'm with Michelle on her theory that maybe Haverbeke wrote this book in another language first. The word choice and verb tense don't always seem quite right. I noticed this in the quote above.

Ch. 5- Higher-Order Functions--
pg. 64-

"Functions that operate on other functions, either by taking them as arguments or by returning them, are called higher-order functions."

Things you can do with higher-order functions:
1. Functions that create new functions.
2. Functions that change other functions.
3. Functions that provide new types of control flow.

pg. 95- Within summary:
Arrays provide a number of useful higher-order methods:
1. ForEach to do something with each element in an array
2. Filter to build a new array with some elements filtered out
3. Map to build a new array where each element has been put through a function
4. Reduce to combine all an array's elements into a single value.
