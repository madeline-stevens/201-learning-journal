# Learning Journal: Day 6 (June 12, 2017)

Today was the start of week 2. Hawa helped Esther and I work through object literals, then we got to explain what we did to Zach and Chai. We would break away and keep working, then team Zach and Chai would come over to us, excited to show us what they learned. Aren't we adorable? Esther graduates from UW's Public Health program tomorrow! Go Esther! I've already told her I'll recap day 7 to her on Wednesday.
