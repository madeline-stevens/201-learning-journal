Answer the following questions for one point each:

1. What is AJAX? Describe why it is asynchronous.
AJAX stands for Asynchronous JavaScript and XML. Before single page applications, the browser would make synchronous requests, which means the browser needs to wait for responses from the server before proceeding with the loading of the page. AJAX requests can happen in the background without waiting for the whole page to load first.

2. Describe 3 features that make AJAX useful, one to two sentences per feature.
  -1. Single page application functionality. AJAX requests allow for partial updates to a page.
  -2. Responses to requests will be faster between client and server because you're not having to wait for the whole page to load each time a client request is made.
  -3. JSON can be used get data back (or you can use xml or html as your data types). This data type has a simpler syntax than other data types which means it is easier and faster to parse.

3. Propose an idea for a website that relies on jQuery and AJAX, a website that you'd be able to create from scratch in the near future.
My 301 project idea was to gather events from different sources (facebook events, meetup events, sports, etc.) to allow the user to see a listing of all these different events, then be able to add the best ones to your ios calendar.

4. Write at least one "user story" -- a sentence or two that describes a benefit to users that visit your proposed site.
As a user I need to be able to see all the events I'm subscribed to via meetup, or the facebook events people invite me to in once app. I need to be able to quickly add the ones I'm interested in to my ios calendar.

5. Write at least one "developer story" -- a sentence or two that describes how AJAX would help you, as a developer, implement the site to make the user story come true.
As a developer I need to keep this app simple and distraction free. I need to let the user be able to tailer the app to their exact needs.
