# Learning Journal: Class 11 (June 20, 2017)

Yesterday we started the bus mall project. Collaborating with Zach, Chai, Kyle, Aaron, Esther, Cameron, and Isaiah is great as always. Many of us are looking forward to code review today to answer a few of our questions. I feel like I didn't get very far yesterday, but with Hawa's whiteboarding efforts I feel slightly better about things.
