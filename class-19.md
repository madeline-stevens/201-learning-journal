# Learning Journal: Day 19 (July 2, 2017)

This is the journal that I should have turned in on Thursday, June 29th. That Thursday was a rough day. We were all getting tired. But this was a day that we learned a lot about github merge issues. Isaiah's computer was giving him grief. We realized we had a lot more to do. We were still learning how to deal with constant distractions from Frederick. I was still clinging to Rachael during the few free minutes we'd get to learn as much as I could and help with our JS.
