# Learning Journal: Day 20 (July 2, 2017)

This is the journal that I should have turned in on Friday, June 30th. On that day I learned that I can finish copying and pasting everyone's about me blurbs for our project, quickly merge with master, update gh-pages as fast as possible with Brandon near by for questions. There were a few things that I really wanted get working that would have made our presentation a bit smoother. We still hadn't had enough time to get a "start game over" button. The title of our game would stop cycling after I think 10 cycle is what Aaron set it at but it ended up not being enough? I wanted to know more about how he did that and I bet we would have gotten the chance to all learn about his dabble in jQuery if there had been fewer distractions.
