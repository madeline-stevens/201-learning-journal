# Learning Journal: Day 18 (June 28, 2017)

Things I am proud of:
* Rachael and her patience. She will sit and walk through code with any of us but be firm if she thinks someone's code shouldn't be pushed to master. And she's learning as she goes too.  
* We are all still really glad the group has stuck together. Even though we're all absolutely obliterated.  
* Isaiah has been such a rock for this team despite what he's going through. I have no idea how he is staying so focused.
* Aaron Mcpeek should be recognized for looking out for fairness and making sure everyone in the class is doing well. I am thankful he spoke up for all five of us. I don't want him to be made to feel like he did anyone a disservice.
* Frederick talked about how he was really appreciative of the group during our group lunch on Wednesday. That meant a lot.

Things I wish were different:
* I wish the VA could support Frederick like they should be. I realize I don't know the whole story and who am I to talk about what someone might need. He obviously has things he needs to share. He is also dealing with so many obstacles. He was in a car accident right before this class and he keeps talking about how he couldn't prepare like he wanted to and he wants to fully heal from his injuries.
