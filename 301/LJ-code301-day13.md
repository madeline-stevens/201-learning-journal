# 301 Learning Journal: day 13 (July 26, 2017)

Oof. Brutal week. And it's only Wednesday.

These are some things we learned today:

- Typing heroku master in terminal automatically starts up node
- Then type heroku open in terminal to open in browser.

- To see your app in deployment environment type in terminal- git push heroku master

- You can make that conString work for both local and heroku site changes. To do this type- export database_url = " # " somewhere...not sure where exactly...?
