# 301 Learning Journal: day 15 (July 29, 2017)

On Thursday, 7/27, in lecture we covered:
1. middleware review
2. PageJS context object
3. Managing state and middleware lab preview

I'm feeling decent about the labs, but my portfolio is so behind. And I would have loved to have the time to apply what we learned in pair programming labs towards my portfolio.

The three big pieces of functionality I would like to implement are:
1. Hamburger button
2. Media queries
3. Constructor function, IIFE, personal github API 
4. Deploying to heroku

I slacked teacher Scott about my plans to continue working on my portfolio after project week if/when it comes to that.
