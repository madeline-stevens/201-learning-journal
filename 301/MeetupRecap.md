1. July 20th: Intro to Redis for php and Node JS (hosted at Avvo)

- Presentation by Brea Gaudioso, Michelle's friend.

- I sat next to and talked to Anna, she's responsible for Wordpress web development for non-profits. She grabbed me and gave me the women in tech talk. I hate that we have to do that. We would all rather be talking about code, not giving each other tips on how to survive. I also had my friend, Nicole join us, she works at Amazon.

2. July 20th: Adobe creative jam hackathon and presenters (hosted by Adobe)

- After the Avvo meetup we all walked over to the Adobe meetup, on the walk over I ran into an old Apple coworker, Dexter, who now also works at Amazon and got to introduce him and his wife, Jessica to everyone.

- There were a series of three talks: Natalie Lew, the 2017 Adobe Resident; Janet Galore, the Creative Director of the Exploration Team at Amazonâ€™s Concept Lab; and Brendt Peterson, creative director at Pop.

3. July 24th: The weekly, Monday JS meetup (hosted by Avvo)

- I met a guy named Glenn from Tableau, Scott from code fellows, and Patrick who spoke so quietly and had a different answer each time someone else asked him where he worked.

4. July 25th: Operation Code (hosted by Code Fellows)

- A guy named Jake Tozier from Bunker labs presented and then a guy named Bruce Bjorklund talked about how he hustled his way into the industry.
- I met Darryl and Adrienne, new students in Code 201. I've also been talking to David a lot and asking him about why he's so involved in Operation Code events.
