# 301 Learning Journal: day 5 (July 16, 2017) (LJ-code301-day5.md)

The class met on campus today, Sunday, to get a good start on our pair programming assignment. I love working with Michelle, she is fun and collaborates so well.

We learned about creating a blog with forms on Friday with Stephanie's class while Scott was sick. It was really great to see Stephanie again and to spend time with her class. But we missed you, Scott!

Some accomplishments during the first week:
* Only missing one day despite having a mild form of strep.
* Chai continuing to be so willing to walk around and help everyone.
* Having Anthony help three of us with our hamburger buttons.
* Code reviewing in pairs, then with the whole class.
* Getting a decent wireframe of my portfolio. Looks decent in Chrome at least.
* Finishing the first Kata on my own with codewars.com after Sunday's class meetup.

To do list for Monday:
* Finish MVP for portfolio (fix hamburger button, template, use Lab 5's tab content switching in my portfolio)
* Finish pair programming.
* Finish three more codewars challenges.
* Finish and submit reading right now.
