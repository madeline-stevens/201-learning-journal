1. Overall Contributions
What contributions did you personally make? Please describe all of your contributions (e.g., artwork, videography, animations, layout, fontography and other styling, HTML structure, JS for DOM manipulation, JS logic, localStorage, Google API, AJAX/JSON, etc.).

- The About Us page! I worked on the about us page in a separate file and Kyle copied and pasted it into the index.html when it was time to pull everything together.
- Sitting with Ian and helping solve homepage html and css issues. I recommended we put a border around all our elements to try to solve our issue of the map not scrolling behind our main nav. Immediately I saw that a div was blocking the map and that applying a z-index of 1 to the nav would bring it to the front and fix our problem.
- Brainstorming with Ian while he was working on the logo. I suggested putting the V in a box for our logo, which we ended up using.
- Zach did a lot of the google maps api and google fusion tables work to get the green county shapes overlay. But he wanted me to help him with placing the facility pins. We worked on the google directions matrix api for the majority of Thursday, seeking help from TA Scott and Christina. Our goal was to have the user input their zip code, hit the submit button and the user would get the distance to all 12 VA facilities. Then we would work on narrowing it down to the three closest facilities. We watched youtube tutorials and came across code pen examples, but it will take more work. Teacher Scott helped us just hours before presentation time and we did get our zip code to take and show up in the chrome console but we needed more time to figure out how to get the distances.
- Being the one to ask for assistance from the TAs. Thank you, TAs.

-Zach and I updated and read our Trello pretty frequently. Zach was so good about adding TODOs for anyone looking for something to do that would help carry out his vision. He was also great about giving people credit within Trello for the TODOs we completed.


3. Collaboration Contributions
Describe how you collaborated with your team throughout the development process (e.g., addressed issues assigned on GitHub, coordinated meetings with team, etc.).

- Actively forcing pair programming on Ian especially, by just sitting next to him constantly. He would think out loud and ask for help. He's a great person to pair program with, and I learned a lot.
- I invited Kyle to pair program with me while I drove the About Us page, but that didn't really happen.
- I recommended that we should probably rehearse our presentation on Friday morning, which didn't happen but that's okay.
- Offering to take headshots of all of us, only Kyle was interested.
