# 301 Learning Journal: day 10 (July 23, 2017)

We learned many things on friday, but this list of three was the big take away.

1. FUNCTIONAL programming: aka declarative programming
- Imperative approach (step by step...)(aka- c#, java, c++)

- Functional programming is NOT so step by step. It will feel like black magic...
- .forEach, .filter, .map, .reduce

2. Mutability and immutability:
- Mutability- An example would be an object whose state can be modified after it is created.
- Immutability- value should stay static. An object whose state cannot change after it is created.

3. Pure function- takes in values, copies them, and returns new values without affecting the global value.  


We also talked about sub-queries.

Scott mentioned that in 401 we'll only be using these four methods (.forEeach, .filter, .map, .reduce) and not using for loops at all anymore.
